This repository holds all the Unity files used in the Game AI Programming course.

For coursework 1 each lab that is to be assessed are marked with the appropriate tags.

In Unity each set of lab tasks has it's own scene file, named for the relevent lab. 

It may be necessary to load the scene for a particular lab even when downloading tagged commits.

Code that isn't my own is marked as such and the location where I found the code is given.

Coursework 2 will also exist in this repository after a re-organisation of the Unity files, afterwhich point the Coursework 1 files will be in the Courswork1 folder.
